BibTex2eCitation
================

A simple Cross-Platform Editor for the ETH eCitation service which adds support to import BibTeX records. This tool is based on a slightly updated version of the NETRef project written by Peter Nelson (peterdn)

In order to simplify the process of updating the current publication list in the ETH Institutional Bibliography E-Citations, we have developed the software eCitationEditor. It allows to edit publications (with all the mandatory and optional fields of E-Citations) manually in a comfortable way. In particular, it allows to import BibTeX records both by importing existing BibTeX database files and by pasting BibTeX records from the clipboard (which is particularly handy when collecting updated bibliographic information from the publisher's online database or from the Web of Science).As a service to ETH employees, here we provide this software for your own use.

**Disclaimer:** *While you are free to use it, please note that we cannot guarantee its correct functioning and that we are not liable for any loss or damage resulting from its use.*

The software is written in .NET, which means it runs on Windows, MacOS X and various Linux distributions. For MacOS X and Linux you will need to install the Mono Runtime (version 2.10 and above). For Windows operating systems, make sure you have installed .NET Framework 3.5 (integrated in Windows 7 and 8).
